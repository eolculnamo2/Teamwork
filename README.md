# Teamwork
Teamwork is a scheduling application which uses React to enhance the applications performance and Mongoose to execute CRUD operations.
Teamwork is still a work in progress, but has several goals: 
  1) Collect relevant employee data.
  2) Provide a platform for communication among employers/employees.
  3) Provide an interface which enables easy scheduling.
  4) Eventually provide an algorithm that will automatically suggests a schedule based on employee preferences, ranking, and employee
  requests.
